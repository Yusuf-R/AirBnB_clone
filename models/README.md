# Models Package

> This file is a WIP :)

This directory contains all modules and packages needed for the **AirBnB** model.

- `engine` (directory): It contains the modules and classes for storage management.
- `base_model.py` (module): It contains the class `BaseModel` from which every other class in inherits.
